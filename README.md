# EcoSculptor-Game
EcoSculptor is a game developed using Unity and C#, crafted by a team of four individuals. It was our graduation project. This game allows players to interact with an ecosystem of creatures trained with machine learning, encouraging them to experience a dynamic environment, struggle for balance, and tackle challenges caused by population imbalances among prey and predators. In EcoSculptor, autonomously moving and deciding entities, generated through machine learning, function as both prey and predators. Players, taking on the role of a god-like figure, are tasked with enhancing the balance and visuals of this virtual world. Unlike traditional environmental education, EcoSculptor provides a dynamic learning experience, allowing players to observe, interact, and experiment with nature in real-time. The autonomous behavior of animals is controlled by machine learning, ensuring a self-generated and evolving ecosystem.
